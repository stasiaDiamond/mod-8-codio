# Mod 8: Styles & Bootstrap

## All That Documentation

Any comment prefaced by tilde (~) are notes I have added and not part of the curriculum

It helps me in the moment and also when coming back later to write detailed comments.

I'm adding some vocab here and taking this to the next level in this bootcamp so that I can attempt to make more sense of a whole lot of new information. This feels like journaling and making my own flashcards all in one. Very cool!

I'm glad I have the time and enough previous coding knowledge to break down each piece of this assignment.

Feel free to reach out if you spot something super incorrect. I want to learn and grow
