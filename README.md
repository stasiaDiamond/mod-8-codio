# Mod 8: Styles & Bootstrap

## Disclaimer/What I'm Doing

Any comment prefaced by a tilde (~) are notes and documentation I have added. They were not offered as part of the curriculum

It helps me in the moment and also when coming back later to write detailed comments.

I'm taking this to the next level in this bootcamp so that I can attempt to make more sense of a vague and ambiguous curriculum.
It's hard to learn coding without vocabulary or lists of covered material

I'm adding some vocab here to supplement the lack of resources given in the MITxPro Emeritus Codio assignment.

I'm glad I have the time and enough previous coding knowledge to break down each piece of this assignment.

Feel free to reach out if you spot something super incorrect. I want to learn and grow

## Resources

Shoutout to ChatGPT and w3schools because the knowledge necessary to succeed was not provided by Emeritus MITxPro. They simply give us the Solution File, so.. shoutout to the Solution File as well, I supposeâ€¦
